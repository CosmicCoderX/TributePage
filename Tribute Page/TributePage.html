            <h3>Here's a timeline of Nikola Tesla's life:</h3>          
            <ul id="tribute-info">
                <li><strong>1856:</strong> Tesla is born on July 10 in Smiljan, Austrian Empire (modern-day Croatia).</li>
                <li><strong>1875:</strong> Tesla enrolls at the Austrian Polytechnic in Graz to study electrical engineering, becoming fascinated by electricity.</li>
                <li><strong>1881:</strong> Tesla moves to Budapest and conceives the idea of a rotating magnetic field, crucial for his AC motor design.</li>
                <li><strong>1884:</strong> Tesla emigrates to the United States, briefly working for Thomas Edison, where they clash over AC and DC systems.</li>
                <li><strong>1887:</strong> Tesla opens his lab and develops the AC induction motor, changing the future of electrical power distribution.</li>
                <li><strong>1888:</strong> Tesla’s AC motor gains support from George Westinghouse, leading to the "War of Currents" against Edison’s DC.</li>
                <li><strong>1891:</strong> Tesla invents the Tesla Coil, a key device for radio, television, and electronics.</li>
                <li><strong>1893:</strong> At the Chicago World’s Fair, Tesla and Westinghouse demonstrate the capabilities of AC power.</li>
                <li><strong>1895:</strong> Tesla's New York lab is destroyed by fire, costing him years of research, yet he continues work on wireless energy.</li>
                <li><strong>1899:</strong> Tesla conducts high-voltage experiments in Colorado Springs, famously generating artificial lightning.</li>
                <li><strong>1901-1905:</strong> Tesla works on the Wardenclyffe Tower project, aiming for global wireless communication but abandons it due to financial issues.</li>
                <li><strong>1915:</strong> Tesla and Edison are rumored for the Nobel Prize in Physics but neither receives it; Tesla struggles financially.</li>
                <li><strong>1931:</strong> Tesla is celebrated on his 75th birthday by the American Institute of Electrical Engineers.</li>
                <li><strong>1943:</strong> Tesla dies on January 7 in New York City at age 86, leaving a lasting legacy in AC power and wireless technology.</li>
